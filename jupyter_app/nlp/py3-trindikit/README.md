# py-trindikit
Python implementation of the TrindiKit dialogue toolkit

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The code is not fully correct, and there is no documentation. 

This is a Python reimplementation of the TrindiKit toolkit, for developing dialogue systems based on the Information State Update (ISU) approach to dialogue management.

More information about TrindiKit and ISU can be found at the TRINDI project homepage (1), and at the web page for the original TrindiKit implementation (2):

2. <http://sourceforge.net/projects/trindikit/>

**Note**: This is a programming library! Good knowledge of Python, and of the ISU approach, is required to be able to use it!
